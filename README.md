# CodeU Open Project: Dishcussion
Dishcussion is a webapp that allows users to rate and search for specific _dishes_ by their preferences. 
<br>
They can search for dishes based on the following preferences:
* cuisine type
* dish type (i.e. entree, breakfast, etc.)
* dietary restrictions.

To provide an analogy, this is our take on a highly customized Yelp experience — but for individual dishes, and not restaurants.
<br>

Our final product is hosted with Google App Engine at the following link: [team15-203908.appspot.com](https://team15-203908.appspot.com/).
