# CodeU Open Project: Dishcussion
Dishcussion is a webapp that allows users to rate and search for specific _dishes_ by their preferences.
They can query dishes based on the following preferences: cuisine, dish type (i.e. entree, breakfast, etc.), and dietary restrictions.
To provide an analogy, this is our take on a highly customized Yelp experience — but for individual dishes, and not restaurants.

Our final product is hosted with Google App Engine, and it can be viewed at the following link: team15-203908.appspot.com[https://team15-203908.appspot.com/].
